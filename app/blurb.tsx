                As a computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh, Ive delved into a fascinating project: crafting a website using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Strapi, a headless CMS. Its not just about showcasing my skills; its about exploring the endless possibilities of modern web development. With each step, Im learning and growing, blending dynamic content management with polished design to create something truly special. Join me on this journey as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital innovation.
